# Details Flowers - Worksheet Update
An exclusive preview for Details Flowers users.

We have some exciting new changes to the worksheet coming with our next major update. We are still wrapping it up before it goes out to our testers and previewers. But, we are so excited about this update we wanted to share a few things with you.

## Build your own worksheet!

You can now completely customize every worksheet. Drag in a new category section and some line items. Rename the section and line items on the fly, and much more.

**Drag & Drop New Components**
Grab a component from the ‚ÄúWorksheet Options‚Äù area and a corresponding drop target will light up to let you know where you can drop it.

**Click to Add New Components**
If drag & drop is not your style, you can quickly add new components by clicking on the empty section of the worksheet. If there are multiple components you can add, it will show you your options. If there is only one option, it will be added right away!

**Made a Mistake? Who put that there?**
If you make a mistake and add too many components, or just want to remove some of the clutter, you can easily delete them.

**Oh, no! That was too easy.**
Mistakes happen, it shouldn‚Äôt be the end of the world. In the ‚ÄúWorksheet Options‚Äù you will see all the sections and line items you have deleted from the worksheet. Drag them back onto the worksheet to restore them. All of their line items and recipes will be restored right along with them. (Pro-tip: you can drag them wherever you want on the worksheet).

**Order Matters! Re-order on the fly.**
Grab the reorder handle on the left end of a line item and drag the item into the order you want. (Pro-tip: you can even drag a line item into another section).

**Personalize for Every Event**
Every bride is special! You can now easily personalize the categories, line items, and recipes in an event without worry of affecting other events or your settings for future events.

**Change the Recipe Image**
Want to change the recipe image to a photo you uploaded in the inspiration gallery? Did you drag an item in and it used that image, but you want something a bit prettier? Just click the recipe image and decide what image you want.

**Add ingredients in bulk!**
Adding one item at a time is so‚Ä¶ well right now. But, if you like to ‚Äúmulti-ingredient-add‚Äù like me then I have some exciting news for you! This update has a new ingredient selector that allows for adding multiple ingredients at once.

**To be taxed? Or not to be taxed?**
That is up to you. Does a recipe have a mix of taxable and non-taxable items in it? You can choose to set the tax on the individual ingredients or on the line item as a whole.

**Simpler Markup**
We have improved the event calculations to not only give you more control over taxes, but more transparency and control over things like markup. Inside the recipe builder you can choose to set a markup and let it calculate a price, or choose a price and let it calculate the markup.

**Somethings should remain private.**
Don‚Äôt want to share what your costs or markup are? No problem. They are hidden in privacy mode.

**Stop Auto-Generating‚Ä¶ üò†** 
I once read a story a computer wrote. It didn‚Äôt make any sense! It‚Äôs better we just give you the ingredients list and you put it where you want it. Click the icon above the description box and the current ingredient list will be copied to your computer‚Äôs clipboard. You can then paste it wherever you like.

**Putting it all together:**
Watch as I put together a simple event (from scratch) in this video. That way you get a good idea of how much easier it will be to customize the worksheet. (Disclaimer: This is not real event and I am programmer‚Ä¶ not a florist).

**Now what?**
After you have completed your worksheet you can press the save button at the bottom of that page to save it as a **new version**, a **new template**, or as **your company‚Äôs default** worksheet for new events.


- **Versions:** There is now a complete history of every save to the event‚Äôs worksheet. It tells you who saved and when. It even has an optional comment box for things like: ‚ÄúFirst Draft‚Äù or ‚ÄúComplete.‚Äù These versions can be restored at anytime. They can also serve as alternates: which will your bride like better, version 1 or version 2? (Versions are available only on the event they were created on)
- **Templates:** Corporate Events, Weddings, Bar Mitzvahs, it doesn‚Äôt matter you can create a reusable template for each. Did your corporate event change into a wedding? No problem, just choose your wedding template. If they cancel the wedding (no inter-office dating) then you can always go back to the earlier corporate version! (Templates are available on all events)
- **Default:** You can also save the worksheet as the default that will be used for all new events.

All of **your current events** will open in the new editor with no migration or additional work on your part. They actually open much faster too! So, no worries there! üëç
